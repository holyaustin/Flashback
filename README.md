# Flashback Frames  app

This is an unusual frame that allow users to request for answers to suffs that happened far back. Friends are expected to crack their memory by selecting the right answer to the question.

A example Poll app using [Farcaster Frames](https://warpcast.notion.site/Farcaster-Frames-4bd47fe97dc74a42a48d3a234636d8c5). 

This example lets you create a poll and have users vote on it. The FrameAction is authenticated against a hub 
so the votes cannot be spoofed, and the results are stored in a redis database.
